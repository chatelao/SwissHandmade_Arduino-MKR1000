# SwissHandmade_Arduino-MKR1000

This respository collects a few informations and tools for the 
new Arduino MKR1000 board. Inspired by the Adafruit Travis-CI scripts:

* Installation scripts to simplify the setup (Arduino Zero + WiFi101, same ICs)
* Datasheets to avoid many downloads
* Whatever needed ... later

Important to know:
* It doesn't work with the older IDE v1.6.5, so be sure to pick v1.6.7
* WiFi101 has to be in version 0.8.0, not the 0.6.0 available in the library manager
